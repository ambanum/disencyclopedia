The [Senate Select Committee on Intelligence](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/) (SSCI) US congressional enquiry into the 2016 presidential election is a good example of a long-term, independent, cross-checked investigation and attribution of responsibility.

See for example [New Knowledge's report](https://www.newknowledge.com/articles/the-disinformation-report/) on this investigation.
