## Political advertising

### [Who Targets Me](https://whotargets.me/en/about-who-targets-me/) 

Who Targets Me is a UK-based initiative created in 2017 by Sam Jeffers and Louis Knight-Webb. Its software monitors the use of political advertising on social media. 

It takes the shape of a browser extension available on both Chrome and Firefox.

Currently, the extension  identifies political ads from major parties in the UK and throughout the EU, as well as in Canada, the US, Australia, Brazil, Ukraine and Israel.

It is citizen-led, since citizens using the extension help collect anonymous political advertising data, which is then analyzed "_to explain the strategies campaigns are using to win votes_". 

In exchange, users can find out which actors are using Facebook to display political ads. When such ads are displayed on their feed, Who Targets Me offers "_a personalised breakdown of those posts [and] information about why you were targeted with [it]_". All that is required is an anonymous profile and a connection to Facebook.

As of June 2019, it has been installed by over 20,000 people in more than 80 countries. It is available in over 20 languages.

Founders work alongside academics and journalists. Their goal is to help increase political ads transparency and democratic trust. 

Ultimately, analyses conducted help recommendations to platform platform operators as well as regulators on these topics. 

Who Targets Me mainly addresses researchers and journalists, aiming to help them better understand the use of targeted advertising on social media during political campaigns.

It is updated following major events such as the 2019 EU parliamentary elections.
