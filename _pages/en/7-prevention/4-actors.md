In 2018 was created the European Commissionâ€™s High Level Expert Group on Digital Disinformation and Fake News to advise and offer lasting solutions to online disinformation and find out "_how to tackle the spread and socio-economic impact of disinformation_". [Lie Detectors](https://lie-detectors.org/) is one of its 39 members. It was created by journalist Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck.

Lie Detectors works by offering free, interactive 90-minute classroom sessions by working journalists and media experts, in Europe, to school pupils aged ten to fifteen. "_Sessions include an overview of fake news, methods of testing for misinformation, and analysis of drivers of the fake-news phenomenon_". As a media literacy initiative, goals of the initiative include the education to news media, an increase in the awareness of misinformation and the information and empowerment of students.

#### What for?

The ultimate goal of Lie Detectors is to increase media and news literacy Europe-wide in order to empower people to make free, informed choices.
