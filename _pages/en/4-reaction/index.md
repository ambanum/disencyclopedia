# Reaction

The phase in which actions are taken to decrease, or at least contain, the impact of an information manipulation campaign.

After some content has matched all [criteria](/encyclopedia#-to-make-it-easier-to-share-and-collaborate-with-others-who-share-your-aim-you-first-have-to-determine-the-criteria-that-guide-your-action) in the [Qualification](/encyclopedia/qualification) phase, assessment and carrying out of the most appropriate Reaction can be taken by any actor.

It is worth noting that, due to the criteria being dependent on each actor, the same Qualification results might end up granting the [Reaction](/encyclopedia/reaction) of one and not of the other.

In our doctrine of engagement, we donâ€™t consider counter-attacks as a valid Reaction, and will thus not provide any references to information manipulation itself.
