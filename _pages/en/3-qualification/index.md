# Qualification

The phase in which suspicious content is tested against criteria to determine if it is part of an information manipulation campaign.

After some content has been considered suspicious enough in the [Detection]({{ "detection" | relative_url }}) phase, it escalates into Qualification. Each [criterion]({{ "/" | relative_url | append: "#-to-make-it-easier-to-share-and-collaborate-with-others-who-share-your-aim-you-first-have-to-determine-the-criteria-that-guide-your-action" }}) is assessed and, if they all qualify, the content escalates into [Reaction]({{ "reaction" | relative_url }}).

It is worth noting that, due to the criteria being dependent on each actor, the same Qualification results might end up granting the [Reaction]({{ "reaction" | relative_url }}) of one and not of the other.

We consider that this is the phase in which software can assist human researchers, but cannot take any decisions on its own.
