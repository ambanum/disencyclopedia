## For political candidates and activists

### [The Pledge for Election Integrity](https://electionpledge.org/)

#### What is the Pledge?
{: .no_toc}

The Pledge for Election Integrity is a call from the  **Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity** (TCEI) to candidates for the upcoming European elections in May 2019. They urge candidates “_to take a stand against election interference by increasing transparency and fight the use of disinformation in campaigns_”.

The Pledge was intentionally launched in a tense, heavy electoral context. Indeed, in the next year or so (2019-2020), major elections will take place in the European Union, the US and Canada.

#### Origins
{: .no_toc}

The **Pledge for Election Integrity** was launched by the **Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity** (TCEI), which was created to prevent election interference, alongside activities regarding democratic awareness, media engagement and education. Overall, the TCEI is a “_bi-partisan group of political, tech, business and media leaders that seeks to foster a more collective approach to preventing the next wave of foreign election interference_”.

The Commission is part of the **Campaign for Democracy program**, which “_aims to become the world’s leading eco-system of dissidents and supporters of democracy_” by “_engaging supporters of democracy worldwide and building a powerful intellectual movement_”.

This Campaign was itself launched by the [**Alliance of Democracies Foundation**](http://www.allianceofdemocracies.org/),  a non-profit organization founded by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former NATO Secretary General and former Prime Minister of Denmark in 2017. Its core mission is “_the advancement of democracy and free markets across the globe_”.

[Here](https://electionpledge.org/#) are listed the five core engagements of the pledge.

#### Who signs the Pledge?

Whether they be political parties or candidates seeking office, “_anyone that is or intends to run as a candidate for the European Parliament elections in May 2019, the U.S. elections in November 2020, or the Canadian parliamentary in October 2019 may take the pledge._”

As of May 09th, 2019, 10 candidates have taken the pledge in the European Union, from Germany, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Belgium, Romania and the U.K. (Scotland).

## For the civil society

### Bad News

[BadNews](https://getbadnews.com/#intro) is an online browser game developed by [Drog](https://aboutbadnews.com/) in collaboration with the University of Cambridge. 

It is based on the inoculation theory, therefore exposing people to weakened versions of disinformation so that they can recognize it in the future and counter its effects. 

It allows players to virtually manipulate information and spread disinformation, in order to better understand its impact - especially in regard to how easily it can be done. 

A junior version of the game exist for 8-to-10-year-old players.

As  of June 2019, it has been translated from Dutch into several languages including English, Bosnian, Czech, German, Greek, Polish, Romanian (including a Moldovan version), Serbian and Slovenian.
