# Definitions

The topic is riddled with an abundance of terms mixing different realities. By consolidating the definitions, we want to facilitate exchanges.

### Coordinated campaign

The notion of _coordinated campaign_ refers to a range of indicators pointing to the diffusion, through various media, of problematic content, by both human and non-human sources.

### Disinformation

Intentional dissemination of information that is wholly or partly false or distorted.
Only the active intention separates it from [misinformation](#Misinformation).


### Fake news
Source: [CAPS report](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/information_manipulation_rvb_cle838736.pdf).

_Fake news_ is the most commonly used expression.

Its use was popularized in the context of the 2016 American presidential campaign, in particular by the candidate Donald Trump, in order to designate press articles critical of him.

This term is vague and does not account for the fact that part of the problem arises from information that is not, strictly speaking, “false" and that phenomena do not always position themselves relative to the veracity of the information.
It has been used so broadly that it can even today designate all the news that one dislikes, or even describe a form of generalized mistrust of the "mainstream" media.

### Information manipulation

Generic term describing the grouping of all intentional forms of dissemination, production or retention of information for hostile political purposes (inclunding the destabilization of populations, institutions and states in order to influence their choices or undermine their autonomy of decision) and carried out in a non-loyal manner towards the receivers of information.

Manipulation is:

- deliberate: its purpose is to cause harm;
- clandestine: victims do not know they are being manipulated;
- not necessarily positioned vis-à-vis the veracity of the information.

Dissemination of genuine information to cause harm, often by moving information designed to stay private into the public sphere.

### Misinformation
