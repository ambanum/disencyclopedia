# Phases

A temporal approach of the fight against disinformation, with moments of reaction to disinformation thought as phases (similar to those of an epidemic), allows for an overview gathering three main, overlapping processes: prevention, research and treatment of disinformation.

Various actors operate within the context of the fight against disinformation, each using its own tools and practices. We however distinguish **three key steps in the treatment process of information**.

## Detection


## Qualification

Each actor determines the **threshold** after which content goes from the Detection phase to the Qualification phase. This threshold is delimited according to the **resources** an actor has and is willing to allocate towards the treatment of an information. The bigger the resources, the higher the **reactivity** of the actor to this information.  The threshold thus depends on the "importance" of the information as measured by the agent, _i.e._ **according to specific criteria**.

By "Qualification", one means the **analysis** of information according to such criteria, which allows its definition and **categorization**.

## Reaction


## Attribution

Determining the origin of the information manipulation.

## Prevention

In the face of false, misleading and/or harmful information, some actors fighting disinformation dedicate themselves to **sensitization** endeavours, among which can be found **media literacy** initiatives aimed at the civil society, or local **proactive measures** (prevention campaigns, deterrent laws, report mechanisms, etc.), for most of which efficiency remains to be assessed.

## Research

A field of **academic research** regarding disinformation and its elimination (if not eradication) has progressively developed these last few years (notably in social sciences and security studies), especially after the acknowledgement of the potential impact of disinformation campaigns on the electoral process and social stability of many a democracy. Empirical observations and analyses are part of the fight against disinformation as they allow for a better, mutualized understanding of issues and concepts related to disinformation.
