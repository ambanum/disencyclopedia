# Types

For each phase, we organise content around four types to help you get to the most relevant elements as fast as possible:

Case studies
: an introduction to the work that this phase entails, by example.

Practices
: references to methods and tips that enable that work.

Tools
: software, datasets, servicesâ€¦ that support these practices.

Actors
: private, public and civil entities worldwide who act in this phase.
