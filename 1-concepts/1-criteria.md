# Criteria

Focusing on disinformation as we do means taking into account a significant yet very specific part of information manipulation. For instance, disinformation is not to be mistaken for misinformation, which is unintentional, nor with propaganda, which does not necessarily aims to disrupt. At least five aspects of information manipulation have to be met in order to identify - and later counter - disinformation campaigns, which constitute in the foreign massive and artificial sharing of false content with the intent to harm.

**Criteria** used to qualify detected content are defined independently by each actor. Of course, **core criteria to define disinformation**, such as falsehood, are common to all. However, more **specific** criteria can be **as various as the ones defining them**. For instance, a Foreign Affairs Ministry will not have the same criteria as an Interior Ministry, for whom the "foreign" dimension of an issue is of minor importance, if of any. The same goes for other agents, from NGOs to social scientists or analysts, who will  focus on specific criteria of information depending on their range of action. Therefore, these criteria narrow the **scope of Reaction** of the agents who define them.

For example, a team working within the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and dealing with disinformation issues, we chose to limit ourselves to five main criteria, which are the **massiveness** of the diffusion of a content, the **artificiality** of its propagation and/or of those who spread it, the **foreignness** of its origin (author, country, state or domain external to the state where the disinformation is spread), the **intent to harm** it bears and the **verifiable falsehood or misleading nature** of information.

These criteria  come from the June 2018 [EU Commission Communication](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018-28/presentationcomm_paolo_cesarini_202D869F-9A13-6D79-FC46C00EAAE3E9AC_53429.pdf)  and the [EEAS Action plan against disinformation](https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/action_plan_against_disinformation.pdf). However, on some points slight changes were made. For instance, the EEAS includes internal as well as external disinformation efforts. The qualifications used by the EEAS of "deliberate" and "large-scale" echo our "intent to harm" and "massiveness" criteria. Massiveness also echoes the word "systematic" used in the report refers to both coordination and a significant power scale. It is intimately linked to "our" criterion of "artificiality". In the EEAS communication, artificiality is also directly addressed as a major part of disinformation since it accounts for the use of bots, fake accounts and video manipulation, among other tools and techniques.
