It studies and exposes online communities by mapping social media clusters and monitor and source disinformation. Its methodology is based on Social Network Analysis (SNA).

The Lab also publishes studies and organizes conferences to initiate and facilitate collaboration, collaboration and sharing of tools and practices between actors (experts, organisations, etc.) countering disinformation internationally.

It also intents to develop a legal framework "_preserving our freedoms while offering a sustainable solution to the disinformation threat_".

#### By whom?
{: .no_toc}

[REVEAL](https://revealproject.eu/) was one of the first projects of the European Commission dealing with verification of digital content. It started in 2013 and formally ended on 31 December 2016.

#### What?
{: .no_toc}

The REVEAL project aimed at developing tools (technologies) and services (methodologies) helpful for social media analysis, especially content verification. Its missions were to help analyze and organize information, protray it intuitively and provide context all the while protecting personal data. Its consortium produced open publications available on the REVEAL website.

#### What for?
{: .no_toc}

Through REVEAL, EU actors seeked to determine the level of trustworthiness of an information, "_predict contributor impact and how much or to what extent all this affects [hidden modalities such as] reputation or influence_", with the overall goal of a "_better understanding and utilization of the social media world_".

#### For whom?

It will provide analysis of social media and web content to detect disinformation and ultimately expose misleading and fabricated content "_through micro-targeted debunking and a blockchain-based public database of known fakes_".
To do so, it will use machine learning, participatory verification and open source algorithms, among other tools and methods.

WeVerify will also provide an open source platform for "_collaborative, decentralised content verification, tracking, and debunking_" as well as a "_digital companion to assist with verification tasks_", datasets and documentation.

#### What for?
