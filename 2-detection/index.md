# Detection

The phase in which content that is likely part of, or subject to, an information manipulation campaign is identified.

Said content can not yet be qualified as disinformation: the only result of the Detection phase is to assess whether a probability threshold is reached, at which stage the content is escalated into [Qualification](qualification) to determine if it matches all [criteria](/encyclopedia#-to-make-it-easier-to-share-and-collaborate-with-others-who-share-your-aim-you-first-have-to-determine-the-criteria-that-guide-your-action). The main aim of this distinction is to help in resource allocation: you need a higher level of expertise in Qualification than you do in Detection.

We consider that this is the phase in which software can act autonomously the most.
