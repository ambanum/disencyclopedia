# Definitions

The subject is riddled with an abundance of terms, mixing different notions and realities. 
Below you will find definitions of the most commonly used terms and a precise definition of information manipulation.

#### Fake news 

is the most commonly used expression and does not necessarily refer to false news but rather falsified, counterfeit, or forged information. 
However, this term is vague and does not account for the fact that part of the problem arises from information that is not, strictly speaking, “false.” 
The term has also become so over-used that it is not uncommon to see it for all news that we dislike, ultimately enabling a form of populism that is hostile to the freedom of the press.

#### Misinformation

is the unintentional dissemination of information that is wholly or partly false or information whose inaccuracy is unintentional.

#### Malinformation

is when genuine information is shared to cause harm, often by moving information designed to stay private into the public sphere.

#### Disinformation

is the intentional dissemination of information that is wholly or partly false. It differs from “misinformation,” which is unintentional. 
This definition is both too broad and too narrow. It is too broad in the sense that it includes benign information that lacks a hostile intention. 
At the same time, the concept of disinformation is too narrow because the problems that we encounter are not all, strictly speaking, forms of disinformation. 
Sometimes information is not false, but simply exaggerated, biased or presented in a very emotional way, such as in a tabloid.
Information can be manipulated in many ways: through the production, dissemination and even retention. These processes do not all imply a dichotomy between truth and falsehood. 
Most of the time, the manipulator does not position himself relative to the truth; he or she is simply trying to produce an effect.

#### Information manipulation

this term is more inclusive. Manipulation is intentional (its purpose is to cause harm) and clandestine (victims do not know they are being manipulated). 
France uses this term encompassing [specific criteria](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/france): a coordinated campaign, the diffusion of false information or information that is consciously distorted, and the political intention to cause harm. 
The notion of a “coordinated campaign” refers less to the idea of an orchestrated operation with certain actors giving orders and others carrying them out. 
It refers more to a range of indicators pointing to the diffusion, through various media, of problematic content, by both human and non-human sources.
