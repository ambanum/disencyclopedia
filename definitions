# Definitions

The subject is riddled with an abundance of terms, mixing different notions and realities. 
Below you will find definitions of the most commonly used terms and a precise definition of information manipulation.

#### Fake news 

_Fake news_ is the most commonly used expression and does not necessarily refer to false news but rather falsified, counterfeit, or forged information. 
This term is vague and does not account for the fact that part of the problem arises from information that is not, strictly speaking, “false.” 
The term has also become so over-used that it is not uncommon to see it applied to all news that one dislikes, driving towards a generalized distrust in media.

#### Misinformation

_Misinformation_ is the unintentional dissemination of information that is wholly or partly false, or information for which inaccuracy is unintentional.

#### Malinformation

_Malinformation_ is when genuine information is shared to cause harm, often by moving information designed to stay private into the public sphere.

#### Disinformation

_Disinformation_ is the intentional dissemination of information that is wholly or partly false. Only the active intention separates it from [misinformation](#Misinformation).

#### Information manipulation

this term is more inclusive. Manipulation is intentional (its purpose is to cause harm) and clandestine (victims do not know they are being manipulated). 
France uses this term encompassing [specific criteria](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/france): a coordinated campaign, the diffusion of false information or information that is consciously distorted, and the political intention to cause harm. 
The notion of a “coordinated campaign” refers less to the idea of an orchestrated operation with certain actors giving orders and others carrying them out. 
It refers more to a range of indicators pointing to the diffusion, through various media, of problematic content, by both human and non-human sources.
