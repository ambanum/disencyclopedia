## Development

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. The version used is the one [currently in production](https://pages.github.com/versions/) on GitHub Pages.

To improve it, install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/fr/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in their [production versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

If the installation of `nokogiri` is problematic with the system versions of `libxml`, you can try to install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) by combining a new installation with the environment variable `NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` set to `true`.

Then clone this repository, install dependencies and run the server:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AmbaNum/disencyclopedia.git
cd disencyclopedia
gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Deployment

Deployment is done with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Just push to the `master` branch to deploy on `ambanum.github.io`.

An Nginx reverse proxy is set up on `disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia` to serve the content deployed on `ambanum.github.io`.
